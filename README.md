# Currency Converter

A responsive currency converter application that uses real-time exchange rates and adapts to all viewports. The client is built with React, TypeScript, and Styled Components, while the server is built with Node.js and Express.

## Getting started

To run the project locally, run the following commands :

`npm install`

`npm run install-all`

`npm run start`

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser and start using the app.

## Drawbacks

Currently the application uses a free API to get exchange rates, which limits the functionality to conversions with EUR as the base currency. Given more time and resources, I would explore other APIs to allow for more flexible currency conversion, making the app more versatile and useful.
